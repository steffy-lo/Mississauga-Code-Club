# MISSISAUGA CODE CLUB

>  _Note:_ This document is intended to be relatively short. Be concise and precise. Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of your application and is non-technical.

  

## Description

* Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective

Our web application provides the Mississauga Code Club (MCC) a way to manage its employees, volunteers, staff, and general administration  (e.g., generating reports of students, tracking work hours) more effectively and efficiently, while coordinating management with parents and students such that they are able to track students' up-to-date records and progress at MCC. This helps smooths the workflow and organization at MCC, and with the modernized management system at MCC administered through the app, the resulting boost in productivity would help MCC achieve its mission of helping kids and youths to become technology innovators and creators.

* What is the problem you're trying to solve?

The problem we are trying to solve is essentially the inefficiency and disorganization with MCC's current management system. In particular, there is currently no digital method of tracking work hours and/or providing progress reports to parents and students. Everything had to be done by hand and it is taking out a lot of time that can be spent doing other productive work at MCC.

* Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

  

## Key Features

* Describe the key features in the application that the user can access

In particular, there will be different user access associated with different account types associated. The key features for each account type are as follows:

#### Administrators

-   View and edit staff, volunteer and teacher accounts, including their related data
-   Supervise and execute the clocking in of staff hours
-   Add accounts, manually or by importing from a document
-   Add courses, in a similar fashion to adding accounts
-   Generate reports for various things, including:
    -   Hours worked by volunteers, staff, and instructors
    -   Students' performance in a course

#### Instructors

-   Clock-in their hours by collaborating with an administrator and view/browse them by date
-   Input performance data for each of their students in each of the courses they are teaching and suggest follow-up courses
-   Track students' performance weekly

#### Volunteers

-   Clock-in their hours by collaborating with an administrator
-   View and browse my volunteer hours by date

#### Parents

-   Track their child(ren)'s performance
-   View all courses taken or in-progress
-   View course recommendations for their child(ren)
* Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature that is most appropriate for your application
* This section will be used to assess the value of the features built

  

## Instructions

* Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective

* How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc.

* Provide clear steps for using each feature described above

* This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully

## Development requirements

* If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?

* Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).

## Deployment and Github Workflow

  

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

* Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.

* If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.

* Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon

* What deployment tool(s) are you using and how

* Don't forget to **briefly explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

  

## Licenses

  

Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

  

* What type of license will you apply to your codebase?

* What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?

* Why did you or your partner make this choice?
