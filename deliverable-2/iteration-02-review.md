 ## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 3rd, 2020
 * Where: Meeting held online through Google Hangout

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well
###### Not requiring formal pull requests for every change
One decision that turned out well was not to require formal pull requests for each change. This allowed us to maintain speed of development and did not cause any major issues with code/product quality.

###### Appointing leads in the front and back end
Another decision was to appoint leads for both the frontend and backend. This allowed some measure of decentralization in the design and management of the development process, as the leads were able to make decisions rather than requiring the entire team to be consulted on every issue.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

###### Weekly meeting agendas were unstructured
One decision that was not as successful was our lack of structured plans for our weekly meetings. This meant that they were often chaotic and without clear, set goals to achieve.

###### Not having members dedicated to long term maintenance
Another decision that was not as successful was our lack of a long term dedicated team member for preparing documentation, including this document. This meant that things like database schemas became out of date, with no reliable expert putting in consistent effort to maintain them. The result was confusion amongst team members.

#### Q3. Planned changes

To address some of our decisions that were not as successful, we are planning on having more specific goals to achieve in meetings going forward. We will also assign one or two team members to handle maintenance and being a subject matter expert on our documentation, especially about database schemas.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
The demo was highly successful. We demoed basic administrator and student functionality, primarily viewing courses as a student. Minor changes were requested, primarily around the language we used on volunteer vs instructor labour. We had originally planned to use ‘paid’ and ‘unpaid’ but the partner did not view this as a very favourable way of referring to it on the front end. Otherwise, the partner accepted the features and was happy with the amount of progress. From the demo, we learned that we should have a better prepared demo plan, structuring what we wanted to show off. Otherwise, the demo was successful.
